## Description

GlorifiedHandcuffs is a lightweight addon which was built from the ground up with optimization in mind. It was made to fit all your needs for a system which revolves around policing. It features a bailout system, jailing system with rewards, a kidnapping system, an interaction menu, and handcuffs which can be used by police or criminals.

You are capable of breaking out of the handcuffs which provide for extra roleplay opportunities. You are also able to drag players who are cuffed, so long as you are the person who handcuffed them. Everything is configurable to the fullest, all the way down to the difficulty of the breakout system.

The system also features a surrendering system, which when the player presses a configured key, his hands will go up. This will show any person in range that he is no longer a threat, as his hands are clearly visible with no weapons in range.

When a player is handcuffed, his capturer is able to press E on him and open the interaction menu. This menu allows the player to see details such as his name, wallet amount, job and weapons. The capturer can choose to confiscate or steal certain weapons, drag the player elsewhere, blindfold the player or gag the player.
